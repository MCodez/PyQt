Dealing with Databases with Python seems very easy but connecting MySql Server with Python 3.6 will surely give you hard time.

Here I will guide you to connect Sql Database with Python 3.6 and execute SQL queries 

Pre Requestives :
1. Python 3.6 
2. Anaconda Distribution for Python 3.6 or Any IDE with sqlite3 library installed.
3. DB Browser for SQLite for Windows 

Anaconda Distribution is recommended because one can find a good IDE (Spyder) for Python in this Distribution with lot of pre installed libraries. "sqlite3" library is pre installed in Anaconda Distribution

 
Tutorial: This tutorial is a "Simple Login Windows App" where user enters Username and Password. If username and password is there in database, MessageBox will say Successful Login else Message Box will say Invalid Username and Password.

Database file and Python Code is enclosed with this README File.
